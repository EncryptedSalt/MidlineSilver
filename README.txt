# FAQ
Q: How do I use this?
A: The new sprites were added to the game as skins, which means you will see the new sprites alongside the vanilla ones. The bigger and rarer Midline hulls with the new skins will need to have their Blueprints found. You can identify the new ships, fighters, stations, and modules in the Codex by looking for the (S) suffix.

Q: Do the new ships have new stats?
A: No, all ships use the same stats as their vanilla counterparts. The only difference is their appearance.

Q: Which ships will show up to start with?
A: Any new ship in the Midline Blueprints will show up in faction fleets.

Q: What new ships are in the Midline Blueprints?
A: These are the Heron (S), Falcon (S), Sunder (S), Hammerhead (S), Drover (S), Centurion (S), and Vigilance (S). 

Q: Do new sprites exist for civilian Midline hulls?
A: No new skins were made for the Kite, Nebula, Starliner, Gemini, and Wayfarer.

Q: What about military Midline hulls?
A: There are skins for all Midline warships.

Q: What's this about fighters?
A: Midline fighters have new skins too! The Thunder and Gladius have variants for the player to use. 

Q: Stations too?
A: Yes, the player can construct a new Midline station featuring the same color of all new ship and fighter sprites. There are no added restrictions or required blueprints.
